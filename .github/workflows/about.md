# About Me

I'm an undergraduate electrical engineering student at Queen’s University with a passion for audio technology and circuit design. My recent capstone project involved developing an electric guitar effects system, blending my technical skills with my love for music. Outside of academics, I'm a multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, and producer, having released two self-produced projects: an EP and an album.
